        <h1>Short Story</h1>
        <h2>Book: The Giving Tree</h2>
        <p>
            The book follows the lives of an apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with one another.
            The tree is very &quot;giving&quot; and the boy evolves into a &quot;taking&quot; teenager, a middle-aged man, and finally
            an elderly man. Despite the fact that the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses the boy as &quot;Boy&quot;
            his entire life.
        </p>
        <p>
            In his childhood, the boy enjoys playing with the tree, climbing her trunk, swinging from her
            branches, carving &quot;Me + T (Tree)&quot; into the bark, and eating her apples. However, as the boy grows
            older, he spends less time with the tree and tends to visit her only when he wants material items at
            various stages of his life, or not coming to the tree alone (such as bringing a lady friend to the tree
            and carving &quot;Me +Y.L.&quot; (her initials, often assumed to be an acronym for &quot;young love&quot;) into the tree.
            In an effort to make the boy happy at each of these stages, the tree gives him parts of herself, which
            he can transform into material items, such as money (from her apples), a house (from her branches),
            and a boat (from her trunk). With every stage of giving, &quot;the Tree was happy.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            In the final pages, both the tree and the boy feel the sting of their respective &quot;giving&quot; and &quot;taking&quot;
            nature. When only a stump remains for the tree (including the carving &quot;Me + T&quot;), she is not happy, at
            least at that moment. The boy returns as a tired elderly man to meet the tree once more. She tells
            him she is sad because she cannot provide him shade, apples, or any materials like in the past. He
            ignores this (because his teeth are too weak for apples, and he is too old to swing on branches and
            too tired to climb her trunk) and states that all he wants is &quot;a quiet place to sit and rest,&quot; which the
            tree, who is weak being just a stump, could provide. With this final stage of giving, &quot;the Tree was
            happy.&quot;
